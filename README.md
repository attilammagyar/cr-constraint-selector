CodeRetreat Constraint Selector
===============================

A small app hacked together in JS to select a random constraint for a
CodeRetreat. Just hit `Enter` or click anywhere to get a different random
constraint selected in a couple of seconds. Edit `options.js` to change the
possible options. Seems to work in Chromium 28 and Firefox 24.
